Next Steps for Completing App:

Create a Delete Route in Index File

Fix the /app/cities vs /cities entry in CityList, which defaults to the latter and therefor cannot smoothly navigate

Big Fix: Migrate the login feature from 'full-mern-stack-code' into the most recent 'worldwise' project. Login feature is fully functional with Mongo DB. Need to figure a way to make sure aesthetics stay same while login functionality points to these working files.
